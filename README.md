# Student-Data-Management-System
This project “Student Data Management System” provides us a simple interface for maintenance of student information. It can be used by educational institutes or colleges to maintain the records of students easily. Achieving this objective is difficult using a manual system as the information is scattered, can be redundant and collecting relevant information may be very time consuming. All these problems are solved using this project.

Throughout the project the focus has been on presenting information in an easy and intelligible manner. The project is very useful for those who want to know about Student data Management Systems and want to develop software/websites
based on the same concept.

The project provides facilities like online registration and profile creation of students thus reducing paperwork and automating the record generation process in an educational institution.
